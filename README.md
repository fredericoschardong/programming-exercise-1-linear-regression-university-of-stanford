# Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression
This repository provides a Python implementation that solves both the univariate and multivariate linear regression excercises proposed in "Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression" from Stanford's Professor [Andrew Ng](http://www.robotics.stanford.edu/~ang/contact.html) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

A brief analysis of the results is [provided in Portuguese](https://github.com/fredericoschardong/programming-exercise-1-linear-regression-university-of-stanford/blob/master/Brief%20explanation%20in%20Portuguese.pdf). It was submited as an assignment of a graduate course named [Connectionist Artificial Intelligence](https://moodle.ufsc.br/mod/assign/view.php?id=2122514) at UFSC, Brazil.
